Domains
=======

What they are
-------------
A domain is a discrete, long-lasting area of skill and activity.

Our domains are:
- **Client:** Communication with our consumers
- **Design:** How it should work
- **Science:** Research & data science
- **Data:** Data ingestion, storage, and processing
- **Systems:** Infrastructure and DevOps
- **Web:** The web-facing product


Why they exist
--------------
As our organization has grown, our work has implicitly clustered around distinct disciplines. This clustering is both natural and necessary, since is no longer possible for any one person to have both a comprehensive _and_ a thorough understanding of all our organization's processes and systems.

Similar to the concept of a guild, domains exist as a construct for those with a specific area of expertise to discuss projects and ideas related to Next Big Sound within their scope. Domain teams should align their priority work to help resolve blockers and solve problems.

Organizing Work
===============

We use [Jira](https://jira.savagebeast.com/projects/NBS) to organize, plan, and track our work as one of the following _issue types_:

- **Sub-task**<br>
	The smallest unit of work within a story or bug (eg. _Create email subscription table_).

- **Bug**<br>
	A reproducible behavior for something that is not functioning as designed (eg. _User cannot export a profile PDF_).

- **Story**<br>
	An independent unit of work, usually expressed as a non-technical sentence that describes an end-user requirement (eg. _A user can subscribe to receive weekly chart emails_). **No story should take longer than a cycle for one person.**

- **Epic**<br>
	A collection of related stories (eg. _Charts_). **No epic should take longer than a few months for one person.**

- **Version**<br>
	A set of stories representing a specific milestone or release within an epic (eg. _Charts Beta_).

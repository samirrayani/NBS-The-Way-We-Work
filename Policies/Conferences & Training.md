Conferences and Training
========================

*This is possibly outdated and needs review.*

At Next Big Sound, we believe that everyone has a story to tell and that everyone can get better at their craft. That is why we encourage everyone to present at least once at a conference or meetup per year, and to attend at least one training class each year. As with our vacation policy, our formal conference/training policy is "do what's right for you, your team, and NBS". You do not need to ask your manager for approval to go to a conference or attend training.

Because we are a scrappy startup, we do have to be cost concious. We've budgeted $15K for 2015 for training/conferences, and we track the remaining amount in a Google Docs Spreadsheet (search for "Conference Budget Tracking"). This budget covers the entire company, and you can use this money to cover costs of attending conferences or training (excluding transportation and accommodations--there's a separate budget for that). This may not seem like a lot, but if your presentation is accepted at a conference, the organizers typically waive conferences fees and sometimes even cover travel expenses. You may also be able to stay with friends or family and otherwise travel on "a budget" to further maximize how far this money can go for the entire team.

Once you firm up your plans, please update the "Conference Budget Tracking" spreadsheet, including the amount you're using for your conference/training. Also, please send out an e-mail to all@ detailing the event you're attending, and including notes on why you chose it. We'll also use this information to publicize our event attendance on twitter/facebook/etc., as appropriate.

Finally, if you'll be out of the office for a conference or training, please update the "NBS: Travel" calendar.

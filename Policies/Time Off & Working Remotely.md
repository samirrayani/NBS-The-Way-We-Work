Time Off & Working Remotely
===========================

At Next Big Sound, we believe that you know best when you need to take time off or work outside your normal office hours. As part of Pandora, all full-time employees are entitled to paid time off during the year based on years of service. We trust you will make these decisions in line with whatâ€™s right for you, your team, Next Big Sound, and Pandora at large.

With that in mind, it's important to communicate any time off clearly and in a timely manner so others can plan accordingly. A good practice for effective communication is:

- Always update the travel calendar with any times that you'll be out or working remotely. It's helpful to include contact & availability information too.

- If you'll be out for a few hours or will be working remotely, post a message in the *#nbs-ooo* Slack channel. Use **@here** to ensure that others see your message.

- If you're going to be out for a whole day or more, email everyone an appropriate amount of time in advance.

Use your best judgement and remember that **over-communication is better than under-communication**.

Executive Meetings
==================

*This is possibly outdated and needs review.*

Ownership is integral to working at Next Big Sound. Very literally, every full time employee has the opportunity to own part of the company through stock option grants. More important, everyone who works at Next Big Sound continuously makes decisions that impact the entire company--from choosing what to work on, where to work from, when to take time off, or how to best spend money on training and conferences.

Next Big Sound is an open company, which is reflected in the transparency with which information is shared in team meetings, one-on-ones, e-mail updates to the company, and in many other ways. And we can be even more transparent: starting Monday, September 8, 2013, you are invited to our weekly exec meetings. Attending these meetings should provide even more context for the great work you do every day. You are, of course, welcome to share what you learn with everyone at the company.

Logistics: The meetings are currently from 10-11:30am every Monday morning. 2 people can join at a time, on a first come, first served basis.

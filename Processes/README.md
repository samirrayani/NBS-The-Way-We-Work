Processes
=========

We only have processes that help us do our best work. These are our minimum standards of process and communication.


Principles
----------

- **Ownership**<br>
	Each piece of work has a single owner responsible for making sure the work gets done and for communicating about it.

- **Self-selection**<br>
	Each individual chooses what to work on based on what engages them, what will have the biggest impact for others, and their long-term goals.

- **Peer-reviewed planning**<br>
	We document peer-reviewed plans before working on non-trivial things.


Work Lifecycle

#### Every cycle:

Meetings
--------

#### Every few months:

- **Roadmap scoping & planning**<br>
	The whole team meets to share, discuss, and prioritize projects for the roadmap.

- **[Dogfooding](Dogfooding.md)**<br>
	Once per quarter, the whole team uses the Next Big Sound platform to perform a set of tasks as a user. The resulting feedback is used to identify any bugs and opportunities for improvement.


#### Every 2 weeks:

- **Cycle scoping**<br>
	Before cycle kick-off, teams define and peer-review the scope of work planned for the cycle.

- **Cycle kick-off**<br>
	At the start of each cycle, the whole team meets to discuss, prioritize, and plan the work for the cycle.

- **Cycle retrospective**<br>
	After every cycle, everyone answers an anonymous survey to share how the past cycle went.


#### Every week:

- **Friday bagels**<br>
	Every Friday, the whole team meets to share new company-wide and external information and to briefly demo any completed work.

- **Domain on-call**<br>
	Each domain has a weekly on-call rotation where the on-call individual is responsible for communicating issues and scoping bugs in their domain.


#### Ad hoc:

- **Critiques** (aka Crits)<br>
	Individuals host an open feedback meeting in which participants critique some planned work. (e.g. design mockups, architecture plans, data science methodology)

- **Project retrospectives**<br>
	After a project, participating members review what went well, what didn't, and what should be changed.

- **Project demos**<br>
	After a project, interested individuals attend an in-depth demo of a completed project.

- **Post mortems**<br>
	After every outage, everyone involved meets to provide an account of what happened, identify any learnings, and plan next steps.

- **Pre mortems**<br>
  Before major changes hold a pre mortem to discuss what could possibly go wrong.  Copy [this](https://github.com/nextbigsoundinc/The-Way-We-Work/tree/master/Processes/PreMortem-Template.md) template to a Google Doc and follow the steps listed to conduct the pre mortem.

- **[Ace series](https://trello.com/b/Mzusq8U8/ace-series)**<br>
	Individuals within or outside of Next Big Sound present topics of interest in an occasional lunchtime meeting.

Dogfooding
==========

From the authoritative [Urban Dictionary](http://dogfooding-to-dogfood.urbanup.com/1187558):

> In a nutshell, dogfooding means "using your own product". A product which is being dogfooded tends to be a lot more polished. When a normal user is annoyed by the product, they can't do anything about it. But when a developer is annoyed by the product, they can stop what they are doing and make the product less annoying.

An effective way to develop an understanding of our clients' product experience is to use our product in the same way that they do.

Here's how dogfooding works at Next Big Sound:

1. **First, we identify user workflows that are representative of our client personas**<br>
	These are common, goal-oriented task workflows that our clients commonly perform. Examples:
	- A brand client searches for an artist for an upcoming media campaign.
	- An A&R client tracks the progress of their top prospects.
	- A book publishing client evaluates the success of different ad campaigns.
	- Someone creates a new account on NBS.com and explores what's possible.

2. **Then, everyone periodically participates in a brief dogfooding session**<br>
	Everyone is individually tasked with accomplishing a specific goal within our products. Examples:
	- As a brand client, find an artist that fits criteria X.
	- As an A&R client, find out how your top prospects are performing.
	- As a book publisher, determine whether ad campaign X or Y was more effective.
	- As a FastCo reader, create a new account and find a few profiles to follow.

3. **We document and synthesize all feedback**<br>
	Everyone should document any bugs, frustrations, and suggestions while dogfooding. These will be consolidated and synthesized into action items, which could be bug fixes or new product ideas.

4. **Finally, we rinse & repeat**<br>
	Repeat this dogfooding process, adding and refining workflows and personas as we discover more about who our users are and what questions they're trying to answer.
